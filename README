	========  =======  ==================================
	crimson	  1.1.3	   http://xml.apache.org/dist/crimson
	java	  1.4	   http://java.sun.com


For development purposes the following packages may also be required:

        Package	  Version  From

The above version are used for generating the source distributions with
are currently generated on a standard RedHat installation. Older version
of these packages can sometimes be used, but could cause build problems.

To check the version number of the tools installed on your system,
use one of the following commands:

Building software
=================

This application is portable to a great number of systems. Building
requires the following steps:

  step 1. Run configure to adjust to target platform
  step 2. Run make


Running configure
-----------------
The configure program will examine your system for various compiler
flags, system options etc. In some case extra flags need to be added
for the C compler to work properly.

For a full list of options, please run:

    ./configure --help


The most important argument is:

  --with-jdk=DIR          use the Sun JDK 1.3.x, 1.4.x, 1.5.x or 1.6.x at the
                          specified location


A typical configure command looks something line:

    ./configure --with-jdk=/usr/local/jdk1.4

The configure script will perform a large number of checks to find all
the header files, libraries and programs the build process needs.
